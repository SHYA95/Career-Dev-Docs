# Design Patterns in iOS

## 📱 Overview
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers.
This section covers various design patterns implemented in Swift for iOS development.

## 🏗️ Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- [Simple Factory](CreationalPatterns/SimpleFactory)
- [Factory Method](CreationalPatterns/FactoryMethod)
- [Abstract Factory](CreationalPatterns/AbstractFactory)
- [Builder](CreationalPatterns/Builder) 
- [Singleton](CreationalPatterns/Singleton) 
- [Prototype](CreationalPatterns/Prototype)
  
### Structural Patterns (Coming soon)
Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

### Behavioral Patterns (Coming soon)
Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.
